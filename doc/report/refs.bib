An algorithm for finding the biconnected components of an undirected graph and an improved version of an algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph are presented. The space and time requirements of both algorithms are bounded by k1V + k2E + k3 for some constants k1, k2, and k3, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges of the graph being examined.},
