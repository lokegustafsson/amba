This thesis introduces AMBA, an interactive system for visualizing the symbolic execution of binaries in combination with fuzz testing.
The visulaization shows in realtime the different execution paths for binaries, while enabling the user to interactively prioritize the different execution paths for analysis based om human intuiton.

AMBA is evaluated in a theoretical comparison with existing tools, with the conclusion that AMBA has the potetial to become useful if the suggested future work is implemented.
The suggested future work is to extend AMBA with state merging for enabling analysis of larger programs; monitoring of system calls called from the binary; and outputing additional meaningful information from the symbolic fuzzing.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
