This thesis introduces AMBA, an interactive system for visualising the symbolic execution of binaries in combination with symbolic fuzz testing.
The visualisation shows the different execution paths of binaries in real time.
The user is able to interactively prioritize different execution paths for analysis.
The symbolic fuzz testing is enabled by the \stoe{} engine.
\stoe{} allows us to do symbolic execution of a whole emulated system, which make it stand out from existing tools.
AMBA is evaluated by comparing to existing tools that we have been able to find.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
