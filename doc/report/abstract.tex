This thesis project presents the development of AMBA, a binary analysis 
tool that utilizes symbolic execution and fuzzing to create an interactive 
control flow graph. The objective of AMBA is to provide a way to analyze 
binary code and identify potential memory-related security vulnerabilities 
by combining the benefits of automatic computing power and human intuition. 
AMBA is created as a set of subsystems using S2E to execute a binary 
symbolically. The methodology of the project involved developing a custom 
S2E plugin, AmbaPlugin, to integrate symbolic execution with dynamic binary 
analysis to create an interactive control flow graph. AMBA uses AmbaPlugin 
to collect information during symbolic execution in order to visualise it.
AMBA can be used by security researchers and developers to improve the 
security of their software applications.
