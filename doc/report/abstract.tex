This thesis introduces AMBA, an interactive system for visualization
the symbolic execution of binaries in combination with fuzz testing. The
visulaization shows in realtime the different execution paths for binaries,
while enabling the user to interactively prioritize the different execution
paths for analysis based on human intuition.

AMBA is evaluated in a comparison with existing tools, with the conclusion
that AMBA has the potetial to become useful if the suggested future work is
implemented. The suggested future work is to extend AMBA with state merging for
enabling analysis of larger programs; monitoring of system calls called from
the binary; and outputting additional meaningful information from the symbolic
fuzzing.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
