This thesis introduces AMBA, an interactive system for visualising the symbolic execution of binaries in combination with symbolic fuzzing.
The visualisation shows the different execution paths of binaries in real time.
The user is able to interactively prioritize different execution paths for analysis.
The symbolic fuzzing is enabled by the \stoe{} engine.
\stoe{} supports full-system evaluation, which makes AMBA stand out from existing tools.
AMBA is evaluated by comparing to a selection of existing tools for analyzing programs on the machine level.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
