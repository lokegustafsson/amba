This thesis introduces Amba, an interactive system for visualising
the symbolic execution of binaries in combination with fuzz testing. The
visualisation shows the different execution paths of binaries in real time,
while enabling the user to interactively prioritize different execution
paths for analysis based on human intuition.

Amba is evaluated by comparing to existing tools, with the conclusion
that Amba has the potential to become useful if the suggested future work is
implemented.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
