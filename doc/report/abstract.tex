This thesis introduces AMBA, an interactive system for visualising the symbolic execution of binaries in combination with symbolic fuzz testing.
The visualisation shows the different execution paths of binaries in real time.
The user is able to interactively prioritize different execution paths for analysis.
The symbolic fuzz testing is done by the \stoe{} platform that utilize modified versions of QEMU, KLEE, LLVM.
AMBA is evaluated by comparing to existing tools, with the conclusion that AMBA has the potential to become useful if the suggested future work is implemented.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
