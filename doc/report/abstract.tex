This thesis introduces AMBA, an interactive system for visualising the symbolic execution of binaries in combination with symbolic fuzzing.
AMBA's graphical user interface have visualisations that shows the different execution paths of binaries in real time.
The user can then based on the visualisations interactively prioritize different execution paths for analysis.
Information about the different execution paths is generated with the help of symbolic fuzzing, which is enabled by the \stoe{} engine.
\stoe{} supports full-system evaluation, which makes AMBA stand out from existing tools.
AMBA is evaluated by comparing to a selection of existing tools for analyzing programs on the machine level.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
