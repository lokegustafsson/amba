This thesis introduces AMBA, an interactive system for visualising the symbolic execution of binary executables in combination with symbolic fuzzing.
AMBA's graphical user interface visualises the different execution paths of binary executables in real time.
The user can then based on the visualisations interactively prioritise different execution paths for analysis.
Information about the different execution paths is generated with the help of symbolic fuzzing, which is enabled by the \stoe{} engine.
\stoe{} supports full-system emulation, which makes AMBA stand out from existing tools.
AMBA is evaluated in comparison to a selection of existing tools for analyzing programs on the machine level.

Keywords: symbolic execution, binary analysis, \stoe{}, fuzzing.
