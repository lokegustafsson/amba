## DONES
- Samuel+*Loke*: Have our own alternative naming for S2E states. Now a fork leads
  to one new state and one of the states is continued in the current state, but
  for rendering a graph we need unique names for the state continued after a
  fork and before. DONE, at the same time as Loke.

## Backlog
- Enaya: **REPORT** Use a sensible documentclass (report), use \chapter for top
  level sections. NO-PROGRESS YET.
- Enaya: **REPORT** debug data, limitations section. NO-PROGRESS.
- Enaya: Store KLEE expressions as metadata to get to some node (from the
  starting node). Evaluate it to a printable expression. IN-PROGRESS

- Albin: Use capstone-rs to disassemble a slice of bytes. Later on this
  will be integrated within the GUI disassembly view. IN-PROGRESS.
- Albin: **REPORT** Introduction (introduce the topic, describe the problem and background
    and our purpose without going too much into detail)

- Linus: **REPORT** Read through whole report and create a plan to start
  attacking. IN-PROGRESS.
- Linus: Write a project arcitecture overview, so that everyone has an
  idea of what every part of the project does. IN-PROGRESS #65.
- Linus: **REPORT** Symbolic input & state forking, evaluation section

- Clara: Represent compressed nodes as an ordered list of original nodes. This
  will help in the implementation of compression algorithm and also be needed
  to reconstruct the disassembly of compressed nodes on the GUI side. IN-PROGRESS.
- Clara: **REPORT** write about related work paper (X-force)

- Loke: **GRAPH RENDERING** LOW PRIO Improve time complexity using
  Barnes-Hut/Quadtree, currently ≈ n^3 in number of nodes.
- Loke: **REPORT** Feature set section, discuss s2e vs symQEMU vs angr vs symCC 

- Samuel: **REPORT** Describe CFG compression a little bit in the graph, why and
  how. Strongly connected components

- UNASSIGNED: create a subcommand that creates a recipe json with no symbolic
  input. NO-PROGRESS. Maybe we just need an example file one can copy and edit.
- UNASSIGNED: create an example recipe file with all features displayed and
  commented (documented). NO-PROGRESS.
- UNASSIGNED: include the computed native addr in CFG node as metadata.
  NO-PROGRESS. Blocked by the metadata struct implementation.
- UNASSIGNED: Send over instruction slice for a node when it is new. Send this
  only every so often. NO-PROGRESS.
- UNASSIGNED: Debug libamba code. Libamba (bootleg valgrind
  reimplementation) is currently broken and needs to be debugged to figure out
  what's wrong. NO-PROGRESS.
- UNASSIGNED: Rewrite recipe crate to do more syntax and semantic checks to
  catch more syntactically correct but semantically incorrect recipe files.
  Example: that the binary is statically linked etc.
- UNASSIGNED: CGC binaries. NO PROGRESS
- UNASSIGNED: GUI tool to choose to prioritize a certain "state" in S2E. So
  that one can focus on a branch that is intresting and ignore others manually.
  This will give more control to the user. Scheduele a state to run later?
- UNASSIGNED: Monitor syscalls made by the binary (hook on `onSyscall`? Is
  there such a thing?).
- UNASSIGNED: Figure out how to do useful state-merging using S2E. Maybe we
  could do something like creating breakpoints for start and end addresses the
  user has chosen or do something automatic if possible, can this be done using
  S2E with some hooks?. Investigation task.

## TODOS (also refer to backlog)
- Samuel: pull out some stuff from the README.md to DEVELOPMENT.md and add
  `cargo2nix -f` bla bla in there too.
- Samuel: Rework PR #69 to be more in line with existing setup expecially
  regarding the FFI boundary.
